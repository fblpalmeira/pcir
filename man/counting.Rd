\title{Create a Count Table with Percentages, Mean, and SD}
\usage{
counting(df1, cols)

counting(df1, cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{df1}{A data frame containing the data to be processed.}

\item{cols}{A vector of column names to be included in the calculation.}
}
\value{
A data frame in wide format containing:
\itemize{
\item Counts of each value per variable
\item Percentages of each value per variable
\item Weighted mean
\item Weighted standard deviation
}

A data frame with computed statistics, including counts, percentages, means, and standard deviations.
df1 <- data.frame(A = c(-1, -1, -1, 0, -1), B = c(-1, 1, 0, -1, 1)),
                  C = c(0, 0, 1, 0, -1), D = c(0, -1, 1, 1, 1), E = c(1, 1, 0, -1, -1))
counting(df1, cols = c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'))
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame and computes the count and percentage of
each value across specified columns. It also calculates the weighted mean and
standard deviation for each variable. The output is a summary data frame
useful for analyzing distributions of ordinal or Likert-type scales.

Create a count table with percentages, mean, and standard deviation.
This function takes a data frame, computes summary statistics like counts, percentages,
means, and standard deviations for each unique value in the selected columns.
