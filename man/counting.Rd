\title{Create a Count Table with Percentages, Mean, and SD}
\usage{
counting(df1, cols)

counting(df1, cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{df1}{A data frame containing the data to be processed.}

\item{cols}{A vector of column names to be included in the calculation.}
}
\value{
A data frame in wide format including:
\itemize{
\item Counts and percentages for each unique value.
\item Weighted mean and standard deviation.
}

A data frame in wide format including:
\itemize{
\item Count and percentage for each value per variable
\item Weighted mean
\item Weighted standard deviation (SD)
\item Total number of observations per variable
}
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame and computes the count and percentage of
each unique value across specified columns. It also calculates the weighted mean
and weighted standard deviation for each variable.

Create a count table with percentages, mean, and standard deviation.
This function takes a data frame, computes summary statistics like counts, percentages,
means, and standard deviations for each unique value in the selected columns.
}
\details{
The output is useful for summarizing responses from ordinal or Likert-type items,
showing how values are distributed and summarized across variables.

\examples{
df1 <- data.frame(
  A = c(-1, -1, -1, 0, -1),
  B = c(-1, 1, 0, -1, 1),
  C = c(0, 0, 1, 0, -1),
  D = c(0, -1, 1, 1, 1),
  E = c(1, 1, 0, -1, -1)
)
counting(df1, cols = c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'))
